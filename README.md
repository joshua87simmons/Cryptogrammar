Cryptogrammar
=============

Cryptogrammar is a program that generates a random cryptoquote for the user to
solve. The quote is randomly pulled from a dictionary and then applied a random
encryption. The user then uses grammatical cues and sentence structure to decode
what the quote says.

The interface is simple to use:<br>
<b>Generate Cryptoquote</b> -- Generates a base random cryptoquote.<br>
<b>Decode</b> -- Prompts the user for a letter substitution. The user replaces
an encrypted letter with the letter they think it represents.
Format:"letter_to_be_replaced=letter_replacing".<br>
<b>Clear All</b>Completely reset all changes to current cryptoquote.<br>
<b>Clear Last</b>Undo last change to current cryptoquote.<br>
<b>Show Answer</b>Reveal the cryptoquote's solution.<br>
